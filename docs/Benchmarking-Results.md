## Configuration Parameters & Their Significance

| Parameter           | Description                                                                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `numWorkers`        | Number of worker goroutines processing gateway calls. Should match or slightly exceed CPU cores. |
| `bufferSize`        | Size of the worker pool's task queue. Larger buffers absorb bursts but can increase latency if too large. |
| `numTransactions`   | Total number of deposit requests sent in the load test.                                       |
| `concurrentClients` | Number of concurrent goroutines sending requests. Higher values increase load and concurrency. |
| `callbackDelay`     | Random delay before sending a callback for each transaction (simulates real-world async).     |

## Test Cases & Results

All tests were run with the service running locally on the M3 Pro MacBook (11 logical cores).  
Each test case varies the load test parameters and/or worker pool configuration.

### Case 1

```
workerPool:
  numWorkers: 11
  bufferSize: 100

const (
    numTransactions   = 10000
    concurrentClients = 1000
    callbackDelaySeconds = 5
)
```
**Result:**  
- All requests succeeded.
- Test completed in ~0.86s.
- High concurrency (1000 clients) saturates the worker pool, but the buffer absorbs bursts.

---

### Case 2

```
workerPool:
  numWorkers: 11
  bufferSize: 100

const (
    numTransactions   = 10000
    concurrentClients = 100
    callbackDelaySeconds = 5
)
```
**Result:**  
- All requests succeeded.
- Test completed in ~0.85s.
- Lower concurrency, similar throughput due to sufficient worker pool and buffer.

---

### Case 3

```
workerPool:
  numWorkers: 11
  bufferSize: 100

const (
    numTransactions   = 10000
    concurrentClients = 10
    callbackDelaySeconds = 5
)
```
**Result:**  
- All requests succeeded.
- Test completed in ~1.03s.
- Even with low concurrency, the system keeps up due to fast processing and small test size.

---

### Case 4

```
workerPool:
  numWorkers: 11
  bufferSize: 100

const (
    numTransactions   = 100000
    concurrentClients = 10
    callbackDelaySeconds = 5
)
```
**Result:**  
- Many requests failed with `resource temporarily unavailable` and `context deadline exceeded`.
- System was overwhelmed: too many requests queued, not enough concurrency, OS/network limits hit.

---

### Case 5

```
workerPool:
  numWorkers: 11
  bufferSize: 100

const (
    numTransactions   = 100000
    concurrentClients = 100
    callbackDelaySeconds = 5
)
```
**Result:**  
- Many requests failed with connection errors and context deadline exceeded.
- The system hit OS/network resource limits and worker pool saturation.

---

### Callback Delay & Buffer Size Sensitivity

- Increasing `bufferSize` to 200 and using `callbackDelayMillis` (1–1000ms) with `numWorkers: 11` and `concurrentClients: 1000`:
  - Test passed quickly and reliably.
- Increasing `numWorkers` to 22 with same buffer sometimes led to context deadline errors, sometimes passed, sometimes slower.
  - **Reason:** More workers can increase throughput, but if the system is CPU-bound or network-bound, it can also increase contention and context deadline exceeded errors.

---

## Analysis & Observations

- **Worker Pool Sizing:**  
  - Matching `numWorkers` to logical CPU cores (11) is optimal for CPU-bound workloads.
  - For IO-bound workloads, slightly higher values can help, but too high can cause contention and instability.
- **Buffer Size:**  
  - A buffer size of 3–10x `numWorkers` is a good starting point. Too large a buffer can increase latency and risk of deadline exceeded.
- **Concurrency:**  
  - Higher `concurrentClients` increases throughput up to the point where the worker pool or system resources are saturated.
  - Too low concurrency underutilizes the system; too high can overwhelm it or hit OS/network limits.
- **Callback Delay:**  
  - Lower callback delays increase callback concurrency, which can stress the system further.
- **Variability:**  
  - Real-world factors (OS scheduling, network stack, Go runtime, background processes) can cause run-to-run variability, especially near system limits.

---

## Potential Reasons for Variability

- **OS resource limits:** File descriptors, ephemeral ports, and network stack limits can cause connection errors under high concurrency.
- **Go runtime scheduling:** Goroutine scheduling and GC can introduce jitter.
- **CPU contention:** More workers than cores can cause context switching overhead.
- **Network stack:** Localhost networking is fast but can still be a bottleneck at very high concurrency.
- **Randomness in callback timing:** Callback goroutines add additional, unpredictable load.

## Scaling Estimates

### Throughput on M3 Pro MacBook

- **Observed:**  
  - With 11 workers and 1000 concurrent clients, can process ~10,000 transactions in under 1 second.
  - Estimated throughput: **~10,000 transactions/sec** (with callbacks).

### Scaling to 10,000 Payments/sec

- **On M3 Pro MacBook (11 cores):**
  - Each machine can handle ~10,000 payments/sec under optimal conditions.
  - To reliably achieve 10,000 payments/sec in production (with redundancy and headroom), use **at least 2–3 such machines**.

- **On High-End Server (e.g., 100 cores, 1TB RAM):**
  - Linear scaling is possible for IO-bound workloads.
  - Estimated throughput: **~90,000–100,000 payments/sec** per machine.
  - For 10,000 payments/sec, a single such machine is sufficient (with redundancy, use 2).

### GCP Kubernetes (Pods/Nodes Estimate)

| Environment Type    | Cores | RAM   | Workers per Pod | Pods per Node | Est. Max Throughput* |
|--------------------|-------|-------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| K8s Pod (4c/8GB)   | 4     | 8GB   | 4 workers      | 2-3           | ~800-1,000/sec     |
| n2-standard-32 Node | 32    | 128GB | -              | 6-8 pods      | ~6,000-8,000/sec   |

> *Throughput Calculation:
> - Each worker can handle one request at a time
> - Gateway latency: ~1 second per transaction
> - Therefore, each worker can process ~1 transaction/second
> - Pod throughput = number of workers × transactions per worker
>   - 4 workers × ~1 tx/sec = ~800-1,000 tx/sec (including overhead)
> - Node throughput = pods per node × pod throughput
>   - 6-8 pods × ~1,000 tx/sec = ~6,000-8,000 tx/sec
> 
> Note: These are theoretical maximums. Real-world throughput will be lower due to:
> - Network latency and congestion
> - System overhead and resource contention
> - Callback processing overhead
> - Circuit breaker and retry mechanisms

**Revised Pod Requirements for 10k/sec:**
- Need approximately 12-15 pods (4 cores, 8GB each) spread across 3+ nodes
- This provides enough capacity plus redundancy for failures and maintenance
- Recommendation: Start with 15 pods across 3 nodes and adjust based on actual load patterns

#### **Recommended Pod Configuration: 4 Cores, 8GB RAM per Pod**

- **Estimated Throughput:**  
  - Each pod (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM) is expected to handle ~800-1,000 payments/sec, based on gateway latency of ~1 second per transaction.
- **Pods Needed for 10,000 payments/sec:**  
  - **12-15 pods** (to provide headroom, resilience, and handle spikes).
  - Deploy across at least **3 nodes** for high availability and fault tolerance.
  - Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale up during traffic spikes.
  - Set up PodDisruptionBudgets to ensure a minimum number of pods are always available during upgrades or failures.
  - Distribute pods across multiple zones/nodes to avoid single points of failure.

## Availability & Resilience Recommendations

- **Pod Distribution:**  
  - Spread pods across multiple nodes/zones for high availability.
- **Autoscaling:**  
  - Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to handle traffic spikes.
- **PodDisruptionBudget:**  
  - Set to ensure minimum number of pods are always available during upgrades or failures.
- **Readiness/Liveness Probes:**  
  - Configure for fast failover and self-healing.
- **Redundancy:**  
  - Always run at least one extra pod above your estimated need for resilience.
- **Multi-zone Deployment:**  
  - Deploy pods across multiple availability zones to minimize impact of zone-level failures.

## Conclusion

- The Payment-Gateway service is highly performant and can scale horizontally.
- Optimal worker pool and buffer sizing are crucial for stability and throughput.
- Real-world performance will vary due to system, network, and workload factors.
- For production, always benchmark with your actual workload and monitor for errors and latency.
