# Ground Rules for Copilot & Human Developers

These rules apply to all code in this repository:

1. Follow idiomatic Go practices (DRY, SOLID, clean architecture).
2. Emphasize correctness, clean code, testability, and extensibility.
3. Use interfaces, clear abstractions, and package-level separation of concerns.
4. Prefer maintainable, readable code over clever one-liners.
5. Always name structs, methods, and vars meaningfully.
6. Include comments where logic is non-obvious.
